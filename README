--- Commands---
	- login <username>::try to log <username> to server
	- list::list all the available users in server
	- send <username> <message>::send <message> to <username>
	- sendall <message>::broadcast <message> to all other online users
	- quit::terminate the client
	- upload <client filename>::upload <client filename> to server
	- download <server filename>::download <server filename> from server

--- Client contents ---
	- header.h::header file
	- client.cpp::application layer code for client
	- dl.cpp::data link layer code for client
	- phy.cpp::physical layer code for client
	- Makefile::Compile the client code.

--- Server contents ---
	- header.h::header file
	- server.cpp::application layer code for server
	- dl.cpp::data link layer code for server
	- phy.cpp::physical layer code for server
	- Makefile::Compile the server code.

--- Compiling ---
	On client or server directory 
	- To compile, simply type: `make` or `make all`
	- To clean the project: `make clean`

--- Executing ---
	Server starts first. It requires no argument and listen to port 5000
	./server
	Clients can start after that, connect to server's port 5000
	./client <server name> <error probability>
	Example, a client connect to CCC machine with error probability of 0%:
	./client cccwork4.wpi.edu 0

--- Known issues ---
	- Download and upload commands work well with text file but it doesn’t work with non-text file. This problem is caused by our design issue: 
	we are using a string data type to pass packets between layers. In testing we found in C++ (string) will ignore everything after '\0'. At the time we discovered this issue, we ran out of time to fix the issue.

	- Error introduction does not entirely work. With over 80% error chance。we cannot transfer big files, but transferring small files and other commands works well.
	- The server is supposed to support up to 20 clients, but we only test with 3 concurrent clients.
